The handling of the z (\"tags\") \n     argument has been improved.\n \n     The \"dummy points\" facility has been removed. \n     This facility was a historical artefact, was really \n     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too \n     long.  Since there are no longer any \"dummy points\", \n     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has \n     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() \n     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character \n     string \"wpoints\" (\"which points\") has been \n     replaced by the logical scalar \"showpoints\". \n     The user should consult the help files.\n\n\nLoading required package: adehabitatLT\n\n\nLoading required package: CircStats\n\n\nLoading required package: MASS\n\n\nLoading required package: boot\n\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(drc)\n\n\n'drc' has been loaded.\n\n\nPlease cite R and 'drc' if used for a publication,\n\n\nfor references type 'citation()' and 'citation('drc')'.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'drc'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    gaussian, getInitial\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:cowplot':\n\n    stamp\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:data.table':\n\n    hour, isoweek, mday, minute, month, quarter, second, wday, week,\n    yday, year\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(pdftools)\n\nUsing poppler version 22.04.0\n\nlibrary(png)\nlibrary(raster)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'raster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:MASS':\n\n    select\n\nlibrary(rgdal)\n\nPlease note that rgdal will be retired by the end of 2023,\nplan transition to sf/stars/terra functions using GDAL and PROJ\nat your earliest convenience.\n\nrgdal: version: 1.5-32, (SVN revision 1176)\nGeospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded\nLoaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 3.4.3, released 2022/04/22\nPath to GDAL shared files: C:/Users/iei031/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.2/rgdal/gdal\nGDAL binary built with GEOS: TRUE \nLoaded PROJ runtime: Rel. 7.2.1, January 1st, 2021, [PJ_VERSION: 721]\nPath to PROJ shared files: C:/Users/iei031/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.2/rgdal/proj\nPROJ CDN enabled: FALSE\nLinking to sp version:1.5-0\nTo mute warnings of possible GDAL/OSR exportToProj4() degradation,\nuse options(\"rgdal_show_exportToProj4_warnings\"=\"none\") before loading sp or rgdal.\n\nlibrary(rgeos)\n\nrgeos version: 0.5-9, (SVN revision 684)\n GEOS runtime version: 3.9.1-CAPI-1.14.2 \n Please note that rgeos will be retired by the end of 2023,\nplan transition to sf functions using GEOS at your earliest convenience.\n GEOS using OverlayNG\n Linking to sp version: 1.5-0 \n Polygon checking: TRUE \n\nlibrary(rminer)\nlibrary(sf)\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.9.1, GDAL 3.4.3, PROJ 7.2.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\nlibrary(snow)\nlibrary(splitstackshape)\nlibrary(terra)\n\nterra 1.6.17\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'terra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:rgdal':\n\n    project\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:data.table':\n\n    shift\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:MASS':\n\n    area\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:adehabitatMA':\n\n    buffer\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages\n───────────────────────────────────────\ntidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n\n\n✔ ggplot2 3.3.6      ✔ purrr   0.3.4 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ lubridate::as.difftime() masks base::as.difftime()\n✖ dplyr::between()         masks data.table::between()\n✖ lubridate::date()        masks base::date()\n✖ tidyr::extract()         masks terra::extract(), raster::extract()\n✖ dplyr::filter()          masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::first()           masks data.table::first()\n✖ lubridate::hour()        masks data.table::hour()\n✖ dplyr::id()              masks adehabitatLT::id()\n✖ terra::intersect()       masks rgeos::intersect(), raster::intersect(), lubridate::intersect(), base::intersect()\n✖ lubridate::isoweek()     masks data.table::isoweek()\n✖ dplyr::lag()             masks stats::lag()\n✖ dplyr::last()            masks data.table::last()\n✖ lubridate::mday()        masks data.table::mday()\n✖ lubridate::minute()      masks data.table::minute()\n✖ lubridate::month()       masks data.table::month()\n✖ lubridate::quarter()     masks data.table::quarter()\n✖ lubridate::second()      masks data.table::second()\n✖ dplyr::select()          masks raster::select(), MASS::select()\n✖ rgeos::setdiff()         masks lubridate::setdiff(), base::setdiff()\n✖ lubridate::stamp()       masks cowplot::stamp()\n✖ purrr::transpose()       masks data.table::transpose()\n✖ terra::union()           masks rgeos::union(), raster::union(), lubridate::union(), base::union()\n✖ lubridate::wday()        masks data.table::wday()\n✖ lubridate::week()        masks data.table::week()\n✖ lubridate::yday()        masks data.table::yday()\n✖ lubridate::year()        masks data.table::year()\n\nlibrary(tmap)"
